### Hello! ✌

My name is Samir Ferreira. I've been working as Test Automation Engineer since 2017 and i'm currently at this amazing company called [Wildlife Studios](https://www.wildlifestudios.com) 😍

I'm passionate about software development, so i'm always learning something new and exciting. My main focus right now is Game Development with Unity 💻

In my free time I like to:
- 🎮 Play video games with friends and my beautiful wife
- 📺 Watch series and anime
- 📖 Read books
- 🎸 Listen to music, mostly rock and metal

Feel free to me reach out 😄
